                <td>I'm Elena, normally I go by 'Strawberry Moon' on the various spaces I visit. I'm a transgender, 17-year-old highschool student who just recently got into computer science. I'm interested in game development and potentially cyber-security, although I'm still not very sure about all of that, I might just keep this all as a hobby :D</td>
